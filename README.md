# OHBM2020
This is the repository for my OHBM 2020 virtual poster.

The poster is created using `posterdown` in R Markdown. You can check out `posterdown` [here](https://github.com/brentthorne/posterdown).

My overall project is about neural mechanisms underlying meditation practices. In this poster, I presented the effective connectivity changes after one month of training in either the meditation (experimental) or relaxation (control) training group.

I used spectral Dynamic Causal Modeling (spDCM), which is a DCM technique commonly used for resting-state fMRI data to reveal changes and differences in effective connectivity after training within each group, and the differences in the change between groups.

I am currently writing up and revising the paper before submmiting it to a journal! Hence, feedback on the poster is welcomed!
